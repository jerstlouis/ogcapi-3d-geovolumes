=== GeoVolumes (3D-Container)

The most general definition of a GeoVolume is a spatial information resource with a distinct bounding volume, a (required) enclosing bounding box (2D / 3D), containing at most one 3D model dataset which is relevant to that volume (items, content) and represented by references to one or more distributions, and includes or references other GeoVolumes (children) whose bounding volumes are fully contained by the parent container's bounding volume. The default representations of a GeoVolume are JSON / HTML information documents which define the bounding box, link to an implicit tileset scheme if applicable, and provide the described sections and links.

This resource is not the same as the collection resource defined in the present draft OGC API - Common but could be considered a specialized type of that collection resource. The collection resource and corresponding collection information document schema were extended in ways that in turn echo the 3D Tiles root node resource (tileset.json). As the definitions of _collections_ and _collection_ evolve with development of OGC API - Common modules, this recommendation may be superseded.

Choices can be made whether to provide a flat list of all GeoVolumes supported by the API instance or only 1-2 top-level or "root" 3D-Container collections which then include child 3D-Containers. The collection information in the collections array may also consist only of the required elements, leaving other elements to be included in the document at the individual collection path.

| List of [link] a| A property with an array of zero or more content references is required. The content of a3D-Container is at most a single dataset (e.g. it may have no content and only children). Each link in the "content" array shall be to a specific distribution of that dataset. The "rel" of each reference indicates its relation to the dataset, such as "original" (the distribution representing the most original version of the dataset, e.g. a CityGML model), or "alternate"(other dataset distributions in different encodings or for different platforms).What a content reference links to is dependent on content type and TBD for some types:
* 3DTiles: tileset.json
* I3S: NodeIndexDocument
* CityGML: Collection document and/or logical space feature (CityModel)
* CDB: Root folder
* 2D features: link to collection information document

=== Bounding Volume

A bounding volume for a set of objects is a closed volume that completely contains the union of the objects in the set.

Exactly one box, region, or sphere property is required. See 3D-Tiles Bounding volumes [http://docs.opengeospatial.org/cs/18-053r2/18-053r2.html%2331[http://docs.opengeospatial.org/cs/18-053r2/18-053r2.html#31]]

| Box | X a| List of [double] +

| An array of 12 numbers that define an oriented bounding box. The first three elements define the x, y, and z values for the center of the box. The next three elements (with indices 3, 4, and 5) define the x-axis direction and half-length. The next three elements (indices 6, 7, and 8) define the y-axis direction and half-length. The last three elements (indices 9, 10, and 11) define the z-axis direction and half-length.

| region a| +

a| List of [double] +

| An array of six numbers that define a bounding geographic region in EPSG:4979 coordinates with the order [west, south, east, north, minimum height, maximum height]. Longitudes and latitudes are in radians, and heights are in meters above (or below) the WGS84 ellipsoid.
| sphere a| +

a| List of [double] +

| An array of four numbers that define a bounding sphere. The first three elements define the x, y, and z values for the center of the sphere. The last element (with index 3) defines the radius in meters.

=== Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

This is the CRS of the coordinates in the spatial extent (property 'bbox'). The default reference system is EPSG:4979 / WGS 84 longitude/latitude/height [http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h[http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h]]. In the Core this is the only supported CRS. Extensions may support additional coordinate reference systems and add additional enum values.

=== Extent

This is the extent of the 3D GeoVolume. In the Core only spatial and temporal extents are specified. Extensions may add additional members to represent other extents, for example, thermal or pressure ranges. It is recommended that the spatial extent be expressed in CRS84 except if this is not possible.

=== Link Relation Type (Rel)

This defines the relationship between the current JSON resource representation and a related JSON resource. For more information see:

* Link Relations [http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html%23_link_relations[http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_link_relations]]
* IANA: Link Relation Types [https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml[https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml]]


The following enumeration is provided as an example. Other relationship types are possible.

* affinemap: Link from a 3D-Container with 2D content to a 3D-Container with 2.5D content (surface, point cloud) to which the 2D content should be texture-mapped.
* alternate: Refers to a substitute for this context.
* collections: The target points to a 3D-container resource which represents the collection resource for the context.
* conformance: Refers to a resource that identifies the specifications that the link's context conforms to.
* data: Indicates that the link's context is a distribution of a dataset that is an API and refers to the root resource of the dataset in the API.
* dataset: Indicates that the link's context is a distribution of a dataset that is an API and refers to the root resource of the dataset in the API.
* describedby: Refers to a resource providing information about the link's context.
* distribution: Indicates that the link's context is a distribution.
* item: The target IRI points to a resource that is a member of the collection represented by the context IRI.
* items: Refers to a resource that is comprised of members of the collection represented by the link's context.
* original: The distribution representing the most original version of the dataset, e.g. a CityGML model.
* parent: link to enclosing 3D-Container.
* root: link to top-level 3D-Container.
* scheme: link to the definition of any implicit tile scheme which sets the 3D-Container organization, extent and/or addressing.
* self: Conveys an identifier for the link's context.
* service: Indicates a URI that can be used to retrieve a service document.
* service-desc: Identifies service description for the context that is primarily intended for consumption by machines.

If multiple areas are provided, the union of the bounding boxes describes the spatial extent.

| crs a| +

In the Core only a single time interval is supported. Extensions may support multiple intervals. If multiple intervals are provided, the union of the intervals describes the temporal extent.

| trs a| +

| String | Temporal coordinate reference system of the coordinates in the temporal extent (property interval). The default reference system is the Gregorian calendar. In the Core this is the only supported temporal reference system. Extensions may support additional temporal reference systems and add additional enum values.

This defines the coordinate reference system of the coordinates in the temporal extent (property 'interval'). The default reference system is the Gregorian calendar. In the Core this is the only supported temporal reference system. Extensions may support additional temporal reference systems and add additional values.
