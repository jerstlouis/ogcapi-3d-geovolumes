*A:*

For each spatial resource collection, the ``extent`` property, if provided, SHALL provide bounding boxes that include all spatial geometries and time intervals that include all temporal geometries in this collection. The temporal extent may use ``null`` values to indicate an open time interval.

---
*B:*

If a spatial resource has multiple properties with spatial or temporal information, it is the decision of the API implementation whether only a single spatial or temporal geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.
