# OGC API - 3D GeoVolumes

This GitHub repository contains the draft OGC API - 3D GeoVolumes specification.

The [OGC API - 3D GeoVolumes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/geovolumes/) candidate standard is part of the OGC API suite of standards.
[OGC API standards](https://ogcapi.ogc.org) define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way.
[OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) is used to define the reusable API building blocks.
